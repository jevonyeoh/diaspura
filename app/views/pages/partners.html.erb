        The Overseas Singaporean Unit (OSU) plans and co-ordinates multi-agency programs and initiatives to engage Overseas
        Singaporeans (OS), and strengthen their connection to home and fellow Singaporeans. The OSU portal is a gateway to a whole host
        of information - from news, policies, and lifestyle updates from back home. Also available on the portal is
        a networking forum to connect with various Overseas Singaporean Organizations (OSO), Singapore Student Associations
        (SSA), and similar Singaporean communities located across the world. The OSU has been extremely supportive of
        DiaS'pura 4, 2013. We are particularly grateful to Ms. Alberenee Sim who has also generously given her time and
        advice to help plan the event. <br><br>
