        <b style="font-size:120%">The DiaS'pura Dialogue</b><br>
        
        These panel discussions are an opportunity for us to, as it were, stand upon the shoulders of giants, to learn
        from and with our fellow Singaporeans who have walked, often against the odds, the proverbial path less trodden.
        From their stories we get a glimpse into what it means to think, and live, outside the box, to challenge conventions
        and to chase one's dreams, even if they do not quite offer the comforting security of a "standard" job. On a more
        macro level, the DiaS'pura Dialogue is also an open invitation for us to deliberate upon the evolving socioeconomic
        and political landscapes of our beloved little red dot; from third world to first, where do we go henceforth?<br><br>
        
        The first panel will comprise Singaporeans intimately involved with the politics of our times - a consummate political
        commentator/social activist and a Nominated Member of Parliament.<br><br>
        
        The second panel will comprise Singaporeans who have pursued what has commonly be seen as unconventional career choices
        - a Geography PhD turned professional ceramist and a relentlessly creative and patriotic theater practitioner.<br><br>
        
        Make sure you join us for a conversation that promises to be candid, expansive and engaging (questions and curiosity
        needed for entrance!).<br><br>
        
        Delicious Southeast Asian food will also be catered for participants!

        Alex Au, 60, sprang into prominence in the 1990s as a gay activist after a corporate career. He was one of the early
        movers in the group People Like Us, at a time when police entrapment was commonplace in Singapore. Beginning in 1996,
        he has been speaking out on a variety of social and political issues through his personal blog Yawning Bread, with an
        unmistakeably liberal point of view. Over time, Au has come to be known as among the foremost commentators on politics,

        <img src="assets/jothie.jpg" width="150" height="100" align="left" style="display: inline; padding-right:10px">
        Jothie Rajah is Research Professor at the American Bar Foundation, Chicago. She is a graduate of the National University
        of Singapore (LL.B and BA (Hons. in English). She was awarded a PhD by the Melbourne Law School. Her dissertation won the
        Melbourne Law School's Harold Luntz Graduate Research Thesis Prize, an honourable mention from the US Law & Society
        Association Dissertation Committee, and the University of Melbourne's Chancellor's Award. Her monograph, Authoritarian
        Rule of Law (Cambridge University Press, NY, 2012), analyses a range of Singapore statutes to show how legislation,
        in tandem with a narrative of territorial and economic vulnerability, has muted critique and augmented state power
        while strategically sustaining state legitimacy. The book argues that Singapore presents a template for illiberal
        legitimacy, highlighting that other states, most notably China, seek to follow the Singapore model of law. Her current
        projects include studies on global discourses on the rule of law, and the construction of Hindu law in the Straits
        Settlements.<br><br>
