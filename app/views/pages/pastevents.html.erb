        We held our inaugural DiaS'pura speaker series in 2007 to stimulate discussion and introspection into the
        question of Singaporean identity. The event attracted over 100 Singaporeans from all over the United States
        and received positive reviews. Since then, the binennial event has increased in size with our last edition
        attracting approximately 200 Singaporeans for the speaker series and a 600-strong audience, selling out the
        Harrison Auditorium at the University of Pennsylvania.<br>
